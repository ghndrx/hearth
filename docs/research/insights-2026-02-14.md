## 1. New Features We Should Add

### 1.1 AI-Powered Features (High Priority)

**Slack's Recent AI Innovations (Jan 2026):**
- **Slackbot AI Agent**: Context-aware personal AI that leverages workspace context for real work
- **Shareable AI Prompts**: Users can share AI prompts via links and unfurls
- **AI Explain**: Delivers instant, context-aware explanations to reduce jargon friction
- **Share AI Answers**: Turn individual AI insights into team knowledge

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Implement a `/hearth-ai` command for channel summarization
- Add "Explain this" context menu option for messages with jargon/acronyms
- Consider optional AI-powered message search with natural language queries

### 1.2 Enhanced Notifications System

**Slack's Notifications 2.0:**

- Clearer channel settings and improved push toggles
- Better mobile controls and advanced unread badge options

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Implement granular notification preferences per channel
- Add "mute for X hours" quick actions
- Support notification scheduling (Do Not Disturb with automatic scheduling)

### 1.3 Split View / Multi-Panel Layout

**Slack Feature:**
- Desktop split view allows pinning agents, threads, channels, canvases side-by-side
- Users can navigate while referencing content

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Add split-view mode for desktop (Phase 2 feature)
- Allow pinning DMs or threads alongside main channel view

### 1.4 Work Objects & Canvas Features

**Slack Innovations:**
- Work objects with full-width file previews
- Canvases with embedded live, bi-directionally synced data
- Canvas analytics (shares and reactions)

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Consider a collaborative notes/canvas feature for servers
- Enhanced file preview with inline editing capabilities

### 1.5 End-to-End Encryption (Matrix Differentiation)

**Matrix Advantage:**
- Full E2EE for text, voice, and video
- User-controlled data on self-hosted homeservers
- Federation allows cross-server communication

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Add optional E2EE for DMs (Phase 3)
- Consider hybrid approach: E2EE for DMs, standard encryption for channels

## 2. UX Improvements

### 2.1 Improved Search & Filtering

**Slack's Omniswitcher Improvements:**
- Easier @ and # tagging with smarter filter suggestions
- Quick links for common filters (people, channels)
- Enterprise Search unifying company knowledge

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Implement fuzzy search with type-ahead suggestions
- Add search filters: `from:user`, `in:channel`, `has:file`, `before:date`
- Show recent searches and saved search queries

### 2.2 Huddles / Quick Voice Interactions

**Slack Huddles Improvements:**
- New mini-player with persistent docked bar
- Refreshed toolbar with easier access to canvases, threads, reactions
- Windowing support for multi-tasking

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Design voice channel UX with floating mini-player
- Allow starting impromptu "huddles" from text channels
- Add quick reactions and thread view in voice sessions

### 2.3 User Profile Enhancements

**Slack Feature:**
- User profiles show all shared group DMs
- Easier to find and jump into conversations with specific people

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Show mutual servers and shared channels on user profiles
- Add "Conversations with [User]" section showing recent DMs/mentions

### 2.4 Workflow Automation

**Slack Features:**
- No-code workflow feature for automated message posting
- Keyword triggers for private channels
- Automated channel setup actions

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Design simple automation triggers (Phase 3: Bot API)
- Consider "channel rules" for auto-moderation

## 3. Performance Patterns

### 3.1 WebSocket Scaling Architecture

**Key Patterns from 2025 Research:**

1. **Gateway + Pub/Sub Fan-Out**
   - Terminate WebSockets at horizontally scaled gateways (Node/uWebSockets, Go)
   - Fan-out through pub/sub bus (Redis, NATS, Kafka)
   - Gateways subscribe to channels and push to local clients
   - *Why it works*: Decouples client concurrency from message production

2. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (Kubernetes)**
   - Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on custom metrics (active connections, message rates)
   - KEDA for event-driven autoscaling (queue length, Redis, Prometheus metrics)
   - Graceful draining when pods terminate

3. **Session Affinity & State Externalization**
   - Sticky sessions for WebSocket connections
   - External session state in Redis for failover support
   - Distributed cache for user/device mapping

4. **Benchmark Reference**
   - Single node: up to 240,000 concurrent connections with sub-50ms latency
   - Achieved through event-driven servers (Go, Node.js) and kernel tuning

**Current Hearth Architecture (from existing research):**
- `architecture-websocket-scaling.md` already documents scaling approaches
- `architecture-database-sharding.md` covers data layer scaling

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure Gateway + Pub/Sub pattern is implemented (Redis Pub/Sub minimum)
- Add Prometheus metrics for connection counts and message rates
- Implement graceful connection draining for deployments
- Target: 50,000 concurrent connections per pod initially

### 3.2 Latency Benchmarks to Target

| Platform | Voice/Text Latency | Uptime |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Discord | <50ms | 99.9% |
| Slack | <100ms | 99.99% |
| Matrix | <100ms | 99.95% |

**Hearth Target:** <100ms for text, <50ms for voice (Phase 2)

## 4. Accessibility Best Practices

### 4.1 WCAG 2.2 Level AA Compliance

**Critical Requirements:**

1. **Keyboard Accessibility (WCAG 2.1.1)**
   - All functionality operable through keyboard alone
   - Logical tab order through interface
   - Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
   - Test with Tab, Enter, Arrow keys, Escape

2. **Alternative Text for Non-Text Content**
   - All images, buttons, icons need descriptive alt text
   - Avoid vague descriptions ("image", "icon")
   - Example: "Contact us via phone" not "phone icon"

3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   - ARIA labels for all custom interactive elements
   - Test with NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS
   - Descriptive labels: "Submit message" not "Click here"
   - Proper heading hierarchy in message threads

4. **Color Contrast**
   - Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
   - 3:1 for large text and UI components
   - Verify current Hearth color palette meets requirements
   - Add color contrast checker to design workflow

5. **Text Resizing**
   - Support 200% zoom without content loss or overlap
   - Responsive layout that adapts to text size changes

### 4.2 Chat-Specific Accessibility

**From LiveChat/Cognigy Best Practices:**

1. **Message Composition**
   - Focus management after sending messages
   - Clear status announcements ("Message sent", "Typing...")
   - Accessible file upload with progress indicators

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - ARIA live regions for new messages
   - Optional notification sounds with visual indicators
   - "X new messages" summary for screen readers

3. **Media Content**
   - Closed captions for video content
   - Text descriptions for audio messages
   - Image descriptions (auto-generate with AI?)

### 4.3 Slack's Recent Accessibility Feature

**Alt Text Reminders (Jan 2026):**
- Users can opt-in to reminders for adding alt text to uploaded images
- Admins can enable org-wide
- Promotes inclusive workspace for low-vision/blind colleagues

**Recommendation for Hearth:**
- Add "Add description" prompt when uploading images
- Optional admin setting to require alt text for images
- AI-powered alt text suggestions
